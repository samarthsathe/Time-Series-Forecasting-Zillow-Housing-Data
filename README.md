# Time-Series-Forecasting-Zillow-Housing-Data

Description:
This project focused on time series forecasting of housing price trends using the Zillow Housing Dataset for Cincinnati. Leveraging R and data modeling techniques, an ensemble approach combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), ARIMA, and Prophet models was employed to forecast housing prices over the next decade. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation techniques, with the final model achieving a forecast accuracy of 92%.

Key Points:
1. **Data Exploration and Preparation:** The Zillow Housing Dataset for Cincinnati was explored through EDA to understand patterns and trends in housing prices over time. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed to ensure data quality and suitability for time series analysis.

2. **Time Series Forecasting Models:** An ensemble approach was adopted, combining the strengths of ARIMA and Prophet models. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a traditional time series forecasting method, while Prophet is a more advanced model developed by Facebook for forecasting time series data with seasonality.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The ensemble of ARIMA and Prophet models was trained on historical housing price data and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess forecast accuracy. This involved splitting the data into training and validation sets, fitting the models, and comparing predicted values against actual observations.

4. **Forecasting Housing Price Trends:** The trained ensemble model was used to generate forecasts of housing price trends for Cincinnati over the next decade. These forecasts provide valuable insights for stakeholders such as homebuyers, sellers, and real estate investors, aiding in decision-making and strategic planning.

5. **Model Performance:** The final ensemble model demonstrated high forecast accuracy, achieving a prediction accuracy of 92%. This indicates the reliability and effectiveness of the ensemble approach in forecasting housing price trends accurately.

This project showcases proficiency in time series forecasting techniques, data modeling, and evaluation methods. By leveraging a combination of EDA, ARIMA, and Prophet models, valuable insights were generated to inform decision-making in the real estate market. The high forecast accuracy underscores the practical utility of time series forecasting in predicting housing price trends with confidence.
